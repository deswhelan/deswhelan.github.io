      <h2>Cultural Blog: Foundations Core Skills Reflection</h2>
      <hr>
      <h4>Describe the impact the core learning has had on your Foundations learning journey.</h4>
      <p>
        The core learning has positively impacted my Foundations learning journey in TWO ways;
      </p>
      <p>
        It has practically benefited my technical learning. The core learning has improved my technical skills in very real ways. Practicing mindfulness has enabled me to tackle and overcome challenges and roadblocks in a calm and stress free manner, with a clear mind. Examining my core values and personality type has enabled me to work on certain areas where I feel I can grow the most – for example practicing mindful listening. Being pushed and encouraged to share personal content on Slack or via my Blog has enabled me to interact and engage with my colleagues in a more meaningful way than I otherwise would have done.
      </p>
      <p>
        It made me <em>enjoy </em>the course more! In addition to the content being useful and meaningful itself, it provided variety and contrast to the technical work. I might have my head down in the library working through some coding challenge one day, then be sipping a coffee in a bustling cafe the next while I write a blog post. This kept everything fresh and exciting. Now that I think about it, the stuff I have spoken about most, and that people have been most interested in, when I speak to others about my course is the core content. This is true for others in the tech industry (who are usually either very surprised, or not at all surprised to hear this is focused on so much) or for people who have no interest in tech stuff at all (the core work is more universal and accessible).
      </p>
      <h4>What are 1 - 3 new things you have learned about yourself as a result of the core learning?</h4>
      <p>
        <ul>
          <li>I am generally positive and appreciative (much more so than I used to be)</li>
          <li>I am a better listener than I thought I was (but only when I am concentrating!)</li>
          <li>I can journal and blog (it’s more enjoyable than I thought it would be)</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <h4>What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</h4>
      <p>
        How much I embraced and enjoyed it.A lot of the core content is similar to stuff I had come across before in part of my development as a leader, or while researching and investigating stuff in my spare time.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, having this formalized and, in a way, legitimized by the priority it is given on this course meant I jumped into it with an enthusiasm and organization which I had not done before.
      </p>
      <p>
        In particular, the meditation and mindfulness practice is something I feel will become increasingly ingrained in my daily habits and overall way of life.
      </p>
      <p>
        I feel I am just scratching the surface of developing this skill, which makes continuing interesting in and of itself. But already I am benefiting for the practical applications of this technique, particularly when it comes to recognizing and defusing stress or negative thoughts.
      </p>
      <h4>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</h4>
      <p>
        I found it challenging to maintain a disciplined routine with practicing mindfulness/meditation everyday.  I aim to practice each morning after I shower. I would say that I have probably practiced 2/3 days on average since beginning. There are two particular scenarios that I find it most challenging to carve out and prioritize the time; 
      </p>
      <p>
        Weekday mornings where I am busy and there is an element of time pressure. Writing this down has made me recognize that these mornings are probably when the practice would be <em>most</em> beneficial.
      </p>
      <p>
        Or weekend mornings when I’m super chilled out and just end up listening to music, making brekky or going for a walk, because I feel chilled out enough already!
      </p>
      <h4>Any thoughts you want to share about your core learning journey in Foundations?</h4>
      <p>
        The main though I would like to share is that this stuff is WORTH IT! If you are reading this and are skeptical or unconvinced by this whole “core” thing, push through and give it your all for at least long enough to have formed some habits. I have seen the very real benefits it can give people in the work place and in their personal lives. When I first encountered EQ/personality content in a work environment a number of years ago, I was initially skeptical. 
        “Here we go, a bunch of touchy-feely corporate BS!” - I was trapped in my own negative cycle of thinking. Since actually trying it out and putitng time and effort into this side of my development, I have never looked back and jump at every opportunity to learn and grow more. DevAcademy Foundations is definitely one of these opportunities, so go for it, it's awesome.
