        <h2>Cultural Blog: Emotional Intelligence</h2>
        <hr>
        <h3>What is Emotional Intelligence?</h3>
        <p>Emotional Intelligence, or EQ, is “the capability of individuals to recognize their own emotions and those of others, discern between different feelings and label them appropriately, use emotional information to guide thinking and behaviour, and manage and/or adjust emotions to adapt to environments or achieve one's goals”. </p>
        <p>In other words, it is your ability to be in tune with, and aware of, people’s emotions (including your own). People with high EQ use this awareness to inform their thoughts, behaviours and interactions with others in a beneficial way.</p>
        <p>EQ can be broken down into;</p>
        <ul> 
          <li>self awareness</li>
          <li>self management</li>
          <li>motivation</li>
          <li>empathy</li>
          <li>social communication</li>
        </ul>
        <p>I recently watched a nature documentary that followed the trials and tribulations of an alpha chimp called David, and how he dealt with threats to his leadership of his social group. I was impressed by David’s EQ in one particular scenario.</p>
        <p>Following a vicious beating from rival, outsider chimps in an attempted coup, David was left for dead when the group moved on to a new area in search of water.
          After resting and tending to his wounds, David found the group and began to do something he had not done before – he began grooming the other males in the group. He formed closer bonds with them in a personal, social way. The next time the challengers to his throne arrived, these new emotional bonds drove the other males in the group to physically protect him which they had not done previously. </p>
        <p>David retained his leadership status not through a rational, IQ driven behaviour (eg using a new weapon/tool to fend off his attackers, like a sharpened stick.) Rather, he used EQ to strengthen the social bonds within his circle, leading to a beneficial outcome and a more stable social hierarchy for all. </p>
        <h3>How is it different to IQ?</h3>
        <p>The difference between EQ and IQ can be described simply as “street smarts” vs. “book smarts” respectively. It could even be thought of as social skills vs. academic skills.</p>
        <p>One key difference is that EQ is “plastic”. You can consciously work on and enhance your EQ skills, while IQ is more “fixed”. While you can increase academic knowledge, it is far more difficult to increase your IQ through study and hard work. </p>
        <p>EQ is also more wide-ranging than IQ. EQ can be thought of as a combination of rational and emotional abilities – in a way, “rational” IQ is a sub-set of EQ. </p>
        <p>Another difference is that EQ can play a major role in positively influencing happiness, stress management and success in leadership positions.  Increasingly, high EQ is accepted as a clearer indicator of success in these areas than IQ alone is.</p>
        <p>EQ can be applied to a wider range of tasks. For example, an exceptionally high EQ is beneficial in almost all social and career scenarios, while an exceptionally high IQ is beneficial in a more specific and narrow set of scenarios.
        </p>
        <h3>Why is it important?</h3>
        <p>I believe the most important thing about EQ is that it positively influences your happiness – what could be more important than that?</p>
        <p>A true understanding of your emotions, and the skill to recognise and control them, can improve you relationships with everyone you interact with. In addition to enabling you to, say, recognise an emotional reaction in yourself so that you can take the time to reconsider your actions, you may will also be able to be more empathetic should you recognise an emotional reaciton in someone else who has not yet devloped that skill. You can now approch a potentially distressing situation fomr a position of understanding the other person rather than blaming or dismiising them</p>
        <p>This skillset can be important in your life as it can enable improved relationships in your personal and professional life. You can look forward with confidence to becoming a happier and more successful person each year.</p>
