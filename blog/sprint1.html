        <h2>Cultural Blog: My Identity, Values and Strengths</h2>
        <hr>
        <h3>My Personal Values</h3>
        <h4>Hard work</h4>
        <p>I grew up working in a family business, my dad’s pub. This instilled in me the importance of working hard and having pride in what you do. If something is worth doing, it’s worth doing well.</p>
        <h4>Honesty</h4>
        <p>I’m a big believer of being honest – with family, friends, colleagues and yourself. This can be challenging in the short term, but is hugely valuable.</p>
        <h4>Respecting others</h4>
        <p>Everyone deserves respect. While my respect for people can grow as I get to know them, and there are certain types of respect which need to be earned, there is a baseline you should never drop below. Be courteous and remember that you never know what people have going on in their lives.</p>
        <h4>Appreciate today</h4>
        <p>“Life is what happens while you’re busy making other plans”. While I think John Lennon was a bit of a gobshite, he got this one bang on. I appreciate the company of those around me, the beautiful country I live in, the fresh air and the privileged life I get to lead. </p>
        <h4>Open-mindedness</h4>
        <p>Being open-minded is such a beneficial approach to life – new people, new places, new food, education, self-improvement. New experiences are fun, and they make you a better person. It’s a no-brainer</p>
        <br>
        <p>The culture I grew up in has had a major influence on my values. My hometown of Wexford is one of down-to-earth people who look after each other, work hard, don’t take themselves too seriously and have no time for arrogance, self-importance or bullshit.
        It’s a great grounding to have. It teaches you to treat people equally not matter what their external “status” may be.</p>
        <p>I then got to experience the culture of Ireland’s top-ranked university and met lots of people form very privileged backgrounds. While growing up in Wexford taught me to be averse to snobbery, uni taught me that reverse-snobbery is silly too. “This person has money and a privileged upbringing, so couldn’t possibly have any real worries or challenges in their life”. Nonsense! We’re all the same. University gave me an external perspective on my own culture and upbringing for the first time.</p>
        <p>I have now lived in New Zealand for six years and I love the culture here. People are down to earth, welcoming and they don’t sweat the small stuff. It also gave me the experience of being an immigrant and having to build your own life, career and whanau. It only enhanced my respect for others who have done this in far more challenging circumstances than my own – fleeing war, overcoming language barriers, supporting a family or facing the type of bigotry that Irish people don’t have to (people generally like us these days).</p>

        <h3>My Strengths</h3>
        <h4>Motivated</h4>
        <p>When I set my mind to something, I get it done.</p>
        <h4>Honest</h4>
        <p>I’m not afraid to be honest with others, or myself. In fact, I’ve had to work on honing and taking the edge of this natural tendency to make sure it always comes form a positive and constructive place.</p>
        <h4>Growth mindset</h4>
        <p>I first learned about the growth mindset a number of years ago on a course in work. It immediately clicked with me as a way to tackle some problems I had been facing and I have worked hard to integrate it into my personal and professional life. The key learning for me was to welcome challenges, embrace changes and tackle everything that comes my way with a positive mind-frame.</p>
        <h4>Smart</h4>
        <p>I initially hesitated to list this as a strength for fear of seeming full of myself. All the people I sought feedback from for this challenge listed “smart/logical” as a strength so that emboldened me to include it here and to be proud of it. I do feel it is a strength. I’m lucky enough that my brain works in such a way that if I tackle a problem it usually won’t let me down, and technical or logical challenges don’t intimidate me. </p>
        <h4>Own my mistakes</h4>
        <p>While this hasn’t always been a strength, I feel it is now. Everyone makes mistakes. Owning, admitting to and accepting your own mistakes allows you to grow and leads to more fulfilling and open relationships with those around you.</p>
        <br>
        <p>These strengths have helped drive me forward in my career. Working in a sales environment I believe my employers and managers have always been comfortable to give me responsibility, trust me with big projects and promote me due to me being self-motivated and welcoming of challenges.</p>
        <p>I also completed some online tests. The <a href="https://www.16personalities.com/estj-personality">Meyers Briggs test</a> identified me as “The Executive” and the <a href="https://richardstep.com/dope-personality-type-quiz/">DOPE</a> test revealed me as an Eagle. These profiles both matched up quite closely with the strengths (and weaknesses!) I had self-identified.</p>
        <p>What I found most interesting when reading these profiles was how they described very accurately what my instinctual, natural, default mindset is. While this manifested itself directly and without filter into my behaviours in the past, I noticed a growing difference between this mindset and my behaviours today. I believe I now have more control and awareness of how to recognise and adjust weaknesses before acting, while looking to maintain natural strengths</p>

        <h3>My Areas for Development</h3>
        <h4>Stubborn</h4>
        <p>I’m naturally stubborn. I’ll defer to someone more knowledgeable all day long, and generally won’t have a strong opinion on something until I’ve done my research. This means that once I do put my stake in the ground, I can be hard to budge and will only be open to sound, logical arguments that change my mind. See – I’m even being stubborn about why I’m stubborn!</p>
        <h4>Empathy</h4>
        <p>This is a weakness I have actively worked on, especially in the five years I have been a people-leader by trade. My brain naturally prioritises the black-and-white facts of a situation above the feelings of those involved. I sometimes have to consciously activate the “empathy” part of my brain, but I’m glad to say that once I have flicked that switch I don’t find it difficult to be empathetic in the vast majority of situations. I just need to remember that it is not always my default setting.</p>
        <h4>Domineering</h4>
        <p>I can sometimes be domineering, forceful and blunt - especially if I doubt the effort, honesty or sincerity of the person I am interacting with. This is regardless of the “authority” of the person I am speaking to. In fact I can honestly say I have acted this way with my managers and superiors far more often than with my direct reports. Again, this is something I have actively worked on and have increasing confidence around. I am proud to say that the feedback from my direct reports through anonymous surveys has sky-rocketed in this area over the years.
        When I first became a leader people often got the “my way or the high way” vibe from me. Now I can say that tend to use the blunt-force approach as a last-resort and have had a number of people thank me for giving them a “kick up the arse” when they needed it.</p>
        <br>
        <p>An example of an experience where I was trying to work with someone else, but there was resistance or tension, was when my work hours were changed with immediate effect with no prior warning by a previous manager.I have chosen this example because it proved to be a major turning point for me in how I approach challenges at work.</p>
        <p>A brief background to this situation; this manager was under increasing pressure at the time and was unfortunately restructured out of the organisation not long after this. Their decision making was becoming increasingly erratic and their decision to change my hours was down to issues elsewhere on his team, rather than being directly related to my, or my team’s, performance -we were actually the top performing team at the time, with 6 months in a row of improved month-on-month results. The change of hours also meant the majority of my direct reports would be without support or supervision for a large portion of each day. It went directly against the recommendations of an external consultant and negatively impacted my team’s performance. Crucially, this decision went directly against a personal guarantee this manager had made to me in order to keep me in the organisation a year earlier.</p>
        <p>In short, it was a poor decision in my opinion. My reaction was terrible. I reacted immediately in an emotional way. I bluntly highlighted why I thought it was a poor decision, and listed other mistakes I felt this manager had made. I highlighted the likely negative impacts on my team’s performance. I even let my direct reports know that I though the decision was a poor one when informing them of the change.I lowered my personal standards due to the poor decisions of someone else. I felt entitled to react in this way because I thought I was right and indulged the instinct to vent at my manager because as my superior “they should know better”. I did not attempt to look at things from their point of view whatsoever.The consequences of this approach were a temporary drop in the performance of my team and the straining of my relationship with my manager.</p>
        <p>I would approach this situation completely differently now. First of all, I would recognise the emotional reaction and take time to process and absorb the decision before acting. I would also try to empathise with and view things from my manager’s point of view. The pressure they were under, the clear apprehension and nervousness they had while delivering the news. The fact that the last thing they needed was their top performer turning on them. I would also have focussed on the benefits and advantages of making an alternative decision instead of just criticising theirs. I would have offered to take them out for a coffee to talk things through once I had had the chance to absorb things, and check in on how they were doing. I certainly would not have made my unhappiness with the decision to so obvious to my direct reports. I had let myself down, acted against my personal values and lowered my standards out of frustration.</p>
        <p>This left me with an ethical decision – how exactly do I put things right, and re-align my behaviours with my personal values?</p>
        <p>I took the following steps; I sought the advice of trusted friends and colleagues.
            I redoubled my efforts at work.
            I owned the mistake and apologised privately and publicly to my manager for the way I had reacted.
            I promised my manager that the proof would be in the pudding – it was one thing to verbally apologise but I was committed to changing my behaviours in the long term.
            I admitted that much of my frustration was down to other factors which I could address – I had been “ready” to react, rather than forced into it.
            I decided to check in regularly with my manager on a personal level and take a more supportive approach to their situation.
            I decided to pro-actively support and assist my team-mates in order to address some of the issues which had led to the decision.
            The outcomes of these actions were truly rewarding. My team-mates and manager were vocal in expressing the respect they had for my decision to front up to my mistake and own it.
            I’m proud to say that months later my manager went out of their way to give me a heart-felt thank you for how I had supported them  and the wider team subsequently, and said it had been “a real pleasure and really great” working with me ever since.
          </p>
        <p>This was the most valuable lesson I have learned to date in a work environment.</p>

      <h3>Sprint 1, Core 4; Introduce yourself on Slack</h3>
      <p>"Hi everyone,</p>
      <p>time for my sprint 1 sharing exercise!</p>
      <p>My name is Des. I am originally from Wexford, Ireland and have lived and worked in Wellington for six years. I love music and collecting guitars and records, and I also enjoy getting outside for runs and zoning out while listening to my favourite podcasts. My partner and I like to stuff our faces with nice food and watch movies in our spare time.
      I currently lead a team of work-from-home insurance consultants, and have worked in a bunch of different contact centre roles over the last five years.</p>
      <p>I've been thinking a lot about my values and identity during sprint 1. One of the exercises I found most valuable was reaching out to friends, family and colleagues to get their feedback and opinions on my values, strengths and weaknesses. I found it fascinating to see how it can crystalize things you already think about yourself, but can also highlight gaps between how you feel and what others perceive. This is something I will do more regularly moving forward.</p>
      <p>I'm attending DevAcademy to fulfill a long-term goal of returning to education and beginning a career in a field I am passionate about that will challenge me. I've always enjoyed both logical/mathematical problems and creative thinking, so development is a perfect blend of the two.</p>
      <p>I'm looking forward to the rest of this journey, in particular the bootcamp when we get to work more closely with our fellow students and facilitators.</p>
      <p>Cheers,<br>Des"</p>
