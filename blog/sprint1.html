      <h3>Sprint 1, Core 4; Introduce yourself on Slack</h3>
      <p>"Hi everyone,</p>
      <p>time for my sprint 1 sharing exercise!</p>
      <p>My name is Des. I am originally from Wexford, Ireland and have lived and worked in Wellington for six years. I love music and collecting guitars and records, and I also enjoy getting outside for runs and zoning out while listening to my favourite podcasts. My partner and I like to stuff our faces with nice food and watch movies in our spare time.
      I currently lead a team of work-from-home insurance consultants, and have worked in a bunch of different contact centre roles over the last five years.</p>
      <p>I've been thinking a lot about my values and identity during sprint 1. One of the exercises I found most valuable was reaching out to friends, family and colleagues to get their feedback and opinions on my values, strengths and weaknesses. I found it fascinating to see how it can crystalize things you already think about yourself, but can also highlight gaps between how you feel and what others perceive. This is something I will do more regularly moving forward.</p>
      <p>I'm attending DevAcademy to fulfill a long-term goal of returning to education and beginning a career in a field I am passionate about that will challenge me. I've always enjoyed both logical/mathematical problems and creative thinking, so development is a perfect blend of the two.</p>
      <p>I'm looking forward to the rest of this journey, in particular the bootcamp when we get to work more closely with our fellow students and facilitators.</p>
      <p>Cheers,<br>Des"</p>
