      <h3>Neuroplasticity</h3>
      <h4>Discuss how understanding the principles of neuroplasticity benefits people</h4>
      <p>
        Put simply, an understanding of neurosplasticuty and how it works enables you to harness its power to develop new skills, as well as bolsters your confidence and belief in your ability to do so. Neuroplasticity has been defined as "the selective organising of connections between neurons in our brains". In other words, every time you learn a new fact or skill, you <em>physically change your brain</em> - pretty amazing, right? Your brain is malleable, and you can physically build nueral networks that enhance beneficial skills and belief. 
        <br>
        Neuroplasticity also teaches us that, as far as your brain is concerned, <em>imagining</em> you are doing something is remarkably similar to physically doing it. Here's a little exercise for you to try out. Imagine writing your signuture. Chances are it took about the same time to imagine as it would to physically write it. Now try the same exerceise, only imagine you are writing your signature with your non-dominant hand. Probably took a little longer this time, right? Just how it would take longer to physically write it with your non-dominant hand (apologies if you are ambidextrous, you'll just have to take my word for it!). This is because the same pat of your brain is activating in both scenarios. Understanding this means you can now improve your skills not only by practicing, but by visualising or imagining you are practicing
      </p>
      <h4>Discuss how might engage with the principals of neuroplasticity for your own benefit</h4>
      <p>
        The very act of understanding and believing in neuroplasticity is beneficial in and of itself. For example, a study by researcher Lisa Blackwell of Columbia University (along with Kali Trzesniewski and Carol Dweck of Stanford University) showed that a group of students who simply <em>believed</em> in the ability of your "malleable" brain to make you smarter improved their grades and outperformed students in a control group. I was exposed to the principles of neuroplasticity and the growth mindset during some course in work a couple of years ago. This exposure strengthened my belief and resolve that I could change careers and become a developer - it's one of the main reasons I am now enrolled in this awesome course!
        <br>
        According to Dr. Lara Boyd, short term learning can broadly be attributed to “chemical” changes in the brain, while longer term repetitive practice is what leads to “physical changes. Think of a time you might have been practising something and made lots of progress in a single session (like learning a new song on the piano) only to sit down at the keys the next day and feel like you have lost some of that progress. You will need to continue practising over many sessions over time to make the significant physical changes to your neural networks which result in you being able to play this song with true ease. You've probably heard the idea that it takes 10,000 hours to become an expert at something. This theory is underpinned in many ways by the practical and physical evidence of how neuroplasticity works. The primary driver of change in your brain is you behaviour - practice really is everything!
      </p>
      <h4>What are some of the ways to increase your Neuroplasticity</h4>
      <p>
        Much like how performing biceps curls makes your arms physically bigger, and more able to lift heavier weights, your brain can become "stronger" through practice,effort and visualisation of new skills. I personally like to reflect and think about challenges and problems on the way to work – either walking throught the forest or staring out the bus window, to build up and strengthen neural pathways.
        <br>
        You can increase your understanding of a new concept immediately by “piggybacking” on existing, strong neural pathways. For example, this is why a good analogy is so effective in helping you understand something.  It taps into your existence understanding of something else, hence bypassing the time it woud take to build up and strengthen a completely new neural pathway

        I'm  big sports fan, so I was fascinated with the idea of revisiting some videos and articles documenting famous athletes who have used the idea of visualisation and practice through repetition to build their skillset and deliver in high-stakes scenarios;

      <h3>Growth Mindset</h3>
      <h4>Discuss what it is and why it is relevant</h4>
      <p>
        The growth mindset was discovered by psychologist and Stanford professor Carol Dweck, Ph.D., and is described in her book Mindset: The New Psychology of Success. According to Carol, mindset is a self-perception (I am a great speaker; I am a bad dancer) that is either “fixed” or focused on “growth.” Professor Dweck is truly the "Godmother" of the growth mindset, and also produced the diagram below which helps explain what it is;
      </p>
      <img class="tech-blog-images" id="growth-mindset-diagram" src="../images/growth_mindset.jpg">
      <h4>In this exploration, did anything surprise you? Change for you?</h4>
      <p>
        Nothing truly surprised me while researhcing the growth mindset -rather, existing beliefs of mine were strengthened and expanded by my research. A key learning for me was the idea that happiness begets success, rather than the other way round. Shawn Achor, whose TED talk I have linked below explained this humorously, and pointed out how constantly chasing success, and assuming happines is on the other side of it, is a fool's errand. The bar for success is simply raised again each time you reach a threshold (good grades? Time for better grades! Hit your sales target? Here's a higher one!). In this way, happiness remains elusive and sits "over the cognitive horizon". Allowing positivity, happiness and a growth mindset to become daily priorities not only brings this happiness forward to the present day, but is also shown to boost a lot of these indicators for success also (e.g. productivity, earnings, sales, grades..). Adopting a growth mindset is therefore WIN-WIN. There is no trade-off between success and happiness - they become self-complimentary.
      </p>
      <h4>How will you integrate growth mindset into your learning journey?</h4>
      <p>
        My personal experience to date has taught me the importance of being pro-active with maintaing positive mindset, and welcoming challenges. For example, before consciously adopting a growth mindset I believed that having a natural, negative, pessimistic response to big challenges was inevitable, and that I simply needed to find a way to cope with this <em>when</em> it happened. I now believe the opposite is true, and that the key is to maintain a healthy and positive outlook so as to take control over <e>if</e> you even have a reaction like this in the first place.
      </p>
      <p>
        Previous to beginning foundations, I had a few regular practices I had integrated into my routine to make sure I was positive and stress free;
        <uL>
          <li>Regular exercise - run or work out at least three times a week</li>
          <li>Take regular, meaningful breaks at work or during study</li>
          <li>Spend some time outside every day</li>
          <li>Have something fun to look forward to every weekend, even if it's just knowing a movie you would like to see</li>
          <li>Spend time with people whose company you enjoy</li>
        </uL>
        Since starting foundations I have added a couple more practices to this list;
        <ul>
          <li>Practincing mindfullness daily</li>
          <li>Replacing "I have to" with "I get to" when it comes to planning out my work and/or study for the week
          </li>
        </ul>
        When I look back on my level of happiness and performance in work before I adopted the practices above, what jumps out to me is how differently I now react to challenges. Just a few years ago, even a relatively small challenge or hurdle in work could make me physically feel stressed, never mind something major. Now, I very rarely feel like this, if at all. I am much happier, and enjoy my work so much more now, and I am achieving better results than ever with my team - not to mention how much my working and personal relationships with peers have benefitied. On top of this, I now study part time on top of work and love every minute of it!
      </p>
      <p>
        The sheer amount of stuff I now get done, and enjoy doing, on a weekly basis would have seemed impossible to me a few short years ago. And, even if you had somehow convinced me that it wasn't, I would have refused to accept it would be achieved without crazy stress and a negative impact on my work-life balance. I am a true beliver in the impact of a growth mindset because I have felt the impact on my own life. I'm stoked that glad foundations and DevAcademy focus so much on this, as it will help students so much. Researching this blog gave me time to pause and reflect on how meaningful it has been to me to date, as well as pick up a couple of new tips and tricks! If you are new to this kind of thing and are reading this blog, my advice is to get stuck in and give yourself over to the human/core skills. It might be the most important thing you leanr on this course.
